Tonight I attended a Meetup about web design process and strategy. Am I a designer? Only fledgling. Am I a part of the community? No but I am trying to be. Why then would I even try to attend a meet up about design? Why would I subject myself to the awkwardness of explaining that "No am I not a designer. I'm not even a web developer yet." It's a scary prospect attending a community meet up in a community you have no real connection to.  Before I go into the reason and explanation of why I am doing these things, lets dive into a bit of a thought experiment.

<h2>Your crazy idea</h2>

Lets say that you have this crazy idea. The idea is very different from every idea that you have had in the past. Odds are the idea is vague, the implementation is challenging and you don't have the skills to start. However you are convinced this the idea is worth pursuing. If only you could gather the skills, the knowledge and the motivation to do it yourself. How would you go about pursuing this idea?

In language studies I read that to truly know and understand a new language you have to be immersed in that language. Your day to day routines have to be in that language. Your ideas and frustrations have to be expressed in that language. Only then will you be able to communicate with people speaking that language. Most of the time language students travel to the region where they can live the language, where everyone around them speaks the language. Why don't we learn all new skills the same way? If you are a plumber you need to be immersed in plumbing (sigh unintentional pun). If you are a locksmith you better understand all the different kinds of locks. If you are a web designer or developer you need to know how people design for the web.

<h2>My crazy idea</h2>


My goal is to learn web design and web development. I am immersing myself in the world and I am trying to fully understand what it means to be a web designer/developer. 

<h2>Immersion Creation</h2>


How do we create this immersive atmosphere when we cannot just travel to a foreign land? My current idea is to fill as much of my life with web dev and design as possible. I want to speak web dev, sleep web dev, and who knows [eat](http://www.meetup.com/TechBreakfast/) web dev. When I am not working my day job I am working on Thinkful coursework. When I am walking to work I am listening to web dev/design podcasts like [Shoptalk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/). I bookmark articles about web dev/design to read later. I follow and keep up with designers in the community via twitter. I attend Meetup groups and conferences about web dev/design. I am fully integrating this work into my life and I believe if you want to tackle that project or idea you have, you need to do the same.

<h2>The Web Community</h2>

Luckily in the web design and web development community there are talented people that are willing to teach other potentially talented people their craft. The Web community is taking all of the benefits of the old trade/apprenticeship model and tweaking it for today's internet filled world. Through the use of Meetup groups and Twitter we can connect with smart people in the community and we can pick their brains to gather critical knowledge about our work. In the web community it is almost required that the most experienced members teach their craft. In DC groups like [RefreshDC](http://refresh-dc.org/) and [DC Tech](https://www.facebook.com/groups/washdctech/#) encourage participation by all and create fun learning events for the DC web community. DC design and development agencies like [iStrategyLabs](http://istrategylabs.com/) are also fully involved in teaching others their skills. I believe the companies see it as a way to build and eventually procure the most talented members of the community. Win, win. 

<h2>Realism</h2>

In the end we'll see if my efforts will help me meet my goal of joining the web dev/design community. We have to be realistic when thinking of the outcome of our efforts. I have set my goal as a challenge but I also have to be happy if I only attain parts of the goal. If at the very least I come out of this journey with a basic understanding of the web dev/develop world, I will still be able to apply my new knowledge to other projects and goals. Again, win, win.

<h2>Thinkful update</h2>

I am working hard on finishing up a first draft on my personal site.  It is clear now that designing is a process where iteration is key. The first project I really designed, [WMATA Redesign](http://blog.albino-squirrel.com/blog/2013/04/20/wmata-nextbus-redesign/), was a struggle. While I don't think I have the best design I do think it is a step in the right direction. For my personal site I am taking all the knowledge I have gained of the 'design process' and I have started to formulate new strategies. I really feel that practice makes perfect in website design. The more projects that I do the better off I will be in learning how to design.
