Railsconf 2014 is here! I'll be taking notes throughout the conference. The goal is to summarize the things and post them here. I hope you are ready!

##Day 0 - Scholars and Guides

The first evening at railsconf 2014 was spent hanging out and getting acquainted with our guides. Railsconf has this awesome scholarship program where new members to the rails community can be paired with a more experienced rails programmer. The goal is to integrate, introduce, socialize and teach the mentee.

I was lucky to hang out with an awesome group of individuals from many different backgrounds. There were guides across the industry from [Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/) to [Enova](http://www.enova.com/). There were scholars from very new to just graduated [Flat Iron School](http://flatironschool.com/).

###How do I find a job? Am I hireable?

I had great conversation about how one makes the jump from self-teaching and personal projects to being hired as a developer. I was lucky to have some people in the room that hire for their current job. There was a general theme that if you are a developer that shows a propensity to learn and stay current, then it will hard to *not* find a job. Sure I summarize and it is never as simple as that, but these were encouraging words for someone just entering the field.

####Two Camps

Though there was a general theme, there were two different camps. One camp thought that there is only so far a developer, not traditionally trained in computer science, could go. The argument was around certain challenges that are hard problems and having computer science as a background help you solve those problems faster.

The other side really beat home the point that if you are excited about the company and committed to learning then a *good* company would be excited to train/hire you. A *good* company is one that follows the philosophy that excited, knowledgeable people make the best developers. If the company places too much emphasis in mundane computer science tests, then they are not the kind of company you want to work for.

This was a great conversation and really puts perspective on where I should focus on my learning.

All in all it was a great experience and if this is a prelude to the actual conference, then I am going to meet some amazing people!
