These next few weeks are about design. This is an area that I don't have a lot of experience in but I hope will teach me a lot. 

I can say that reading about design and to a larger extent taking a course about web design/development has opened my mind to examples in everyday life. 

One example that continues to irk me is the lack of decently designed mobile restaurant pages in Washington DC. Almost every restaurant website that I have been to recently has redirected me to a mobile site, given me unclear instructions on how to view the full site, not provided a responsive layout, and is generally crap. The sites are ugly, not functional, and usually only three buttons: menu, directions, contact us. Ok so you included menu, that's probably why I am there anyway <click> oh it's just a .pdf that takes forever to download and is out of date? Great. Sigh seriously they are all crap. I wonder if any other cities have this problem.

Now it's back to trying to find dinner on my phone <headdesk>...
